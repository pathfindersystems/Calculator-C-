This C++ program implements a simple task management system. Here's a brief explanation of its structure and functionality:

1. We define a `Task` class to represent individual tasks, with a description and a completion status.

2. The `TaskManager` class manages a collection of tasks and provides methods to add, view, mark as completed, and remove tasks.

3. The `main()` function provides a command-line interface for interacting with the task manager.

4. Users can choose from five options:
   - Add a new task
   - View all tasks
   - Mark a task as completed
   - Remove a task
   - Exit the program

5. The program uses a `while` loop to keep running until the user chooses to exit.

To use this program:

1. Save the code in a file with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `task_manager.cpp`).
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, with g++:
   ```
   g++ -std=c++11 task_manager.cpp -o task_manager
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./task_manager
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your tasks.

This program demonstrates several C++ features, including:
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- STL containers (`std::vector`)
- Input/output streams
- Control structures (switch statements, loops)
- Basic error handling
